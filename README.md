# MACARS

This is my attempt on re-creating the LCARS interface ("Okudagrams") from the Star Trek
television series using pure HTML / CSS. It's convention based see [macars page](https://ellerbus.github.io/macars/)
for an example of it's usage. Disclaimer: I wanted a fully functional set of elements that
included inputs and dropdowns - which I haven't been able to find any exmaples of - so this
is not a fully compliant LCARS stylesheet - the purist in you will not like this :).

### General LCARS IP

CBS, the studio that owns the rights to the Star Trek assets hold the view that using an LCARS
interface on a paid app is infringing on their copyright (ie) don't use this project for any
commercial product.
