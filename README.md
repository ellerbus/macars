# MACARS

This is my take on re-creating the LCARS interface ("Okudagrams") from the Star Trek
television series using pure HTML / CSS. It's convention based see [index.html](index.html)
for an example of it's usage.

### General LCARS IP

CBS, the studio that owns the rights to the Star Trek assets hold the view that using an LCARS
interface on a paid app is infringing on their copyright (ie) don't use this project for any
commercial product.

## Installation

```
npm install
```

Then, run

```
npm run sass
```
