# FACARS

This is my take on re-creating the LCARS interface ("Okudagrams") from the Star Trek
television series using pure HTML / CSS. It's convention based see [index.html](index.html)
for an example of it's usage. Disclaimer: I wanted a fully functional set of elements that
included inputs and dropdowns - which I haven't been able to find any exmaples of - so this
is not a fully compliant LCARS stylesheet.

### General LCARS IP

CBS, the studio that owns the rights to the Star Trek assets hold the view that using an LCARS
interface on a paid app is infringing on their copyright (ie) don't use this project for any
commercial product.
